# SafeStart

Improvements in image processing and artificial intelligence techniques in recent years have opened the door to alcohol screening using gait analysis. However, human shape segmentation from real-word recordings faces a number of obstacles, including diverse background contents, uneven illumination or even the presence of shadows, which prevents proper generalization of those models. Today, we propose SafeStart, an efficient pipeline for robust gait analysis is addressed using a combination of image processing tools. Proper method to estimate the background is first investigated, which is used to highlight the moving body. Study of the best performing pipeline to extract the binary silhouette is then studied, offering promising results that can serve as efficient pre-processing before feeding the transformed data into different AI models.
